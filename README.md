## Features

### 1. Dashboard Overview
- **Summary cards** — Total Vault Balance, Monthly Inflow, Monthly Outflow with animated count-up numbers
- **Balance Trend chart** — Animated SVG line chart with 5 time filters (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, MAX), smooth cubic bezier curves, hover tooltip with date/amount/delta
- **Spending Breakdown** — Interactive donut chart with per-category hover highlights
- **Recent Transactions** — Live feed of the latest ledger entries

### 2. Transactions (Financial Ledger)
- Full transaction table with Date/Time, Description, Amount, Category, Type
- **Category filter** — dropdown to filter by any spending category
- **Sort By** — Latest First, Oldest First, Amount High→Low, Amount Low→High
- **Global Search** — "Search Zorvyn..." bar in the header filters transactions in real time
- **Pagination** — 8 items per page with smart ellipsis pagination
- **Empty state** — graceful "No transactions match" message when filters yield nothing
- Summary stats footer — Total Flow, Net Income, Operating Expenses, Audit Compliance

### 3. Role-Based UI (Frontend Simulation)
Switch roles instantly via the **`● Admin` / `● Viewer` pill** in the top bar (no reload needed).

| Action | Admin | Viewer |
|---|---|---|
| View all data | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add transaction | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit transaction | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete transaction | ✅ | ❌ |
| Actions column | Edit + Delete buttons | "View Only" label |

Role is persisted in `localStorage` so it survives page refreshes.

### 4. Insights
- **Top Expense Category** — highest spend with % of total outflow
- **Monthly Flow Comparison** — weekly bar chart comparing this month vs last
- **Spending by Category** — all categories ranked by outflow with color-coded bars
- **Dynamic Signals** — algorithmic observations: spending velocity vs prior week, savings rate vs target, category dominance warnings
- **Savings Potential card** — inflow vs retention vs deployment capacity

### 5. Settings
- **Profile** — editable full name, email, bio
- **Security** — 2FA status, active session management, security protocols list
- **Display** — dark/light mode toggle, motion/animation toggle
- **Savings Goal** — adjustable target savings rate (1–80%) used by Insights signals

### 6. State Management
All state lives in `AppContext` and is exported via `useAppContext()`:

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| `activeRole` | "Admin" or "Viewer" — persisted to localStorage |
| `transactions` | Full transaction array, supports add/update/delete |
| `searchTerm` | Global search string — filters `filteredTransactions` |
| `selectedCategory` | Category filter dropdown value |
| `sortOrder` | "latest" / "oldest" / "amount-high" / "amount-low" |
| `theme` | "light" or "dark" — persisted to localStorage |
| `motionEnabled` | Enables/disables all Framer Motion animations |
| `userProfile` | Name, email, bio — persisted to localStorage |
| `savingsGoal` | Target savings % — persisted to localStorage |

Derived values (totals, filteredTransactions, spendingCategories, insights signals, etc.) are computed with `useMemo` and never stored redundantly.

---

## Optional Enhancements Implemented

- ✅ **Dark mode** — full class-based dark mode with toggle, persisted to localStorage
- ✅ **Data persistence** — role, theme, profile, savings goal all survive page refresh
- ✅ **Animations** — Framer Motion page transitions, chart draw-in, count-up numbers, donut arc animations, staggered list entries
- ✅ **Advanced filtering** — category + sort + global search combined

## Notes & Assumptions

- All data is **mock/static** — no backend dependency, as specified in the assignment
- Role-based behavior is **intentionally frontend-only** as the assignment requires
- Amount values are stored as formatted strings (e.g., `"- $2,490.00"`) and parsed numerically for calculations
- The Balance Trend chart uses **generated time-series data** derived from the transaction dataset to simulate portfolio value over time
